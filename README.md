# Compute
OpenCL acceleration for C# with IL kernels.

## OpenCL acceleration
This project provides abstracted binding to native the OpenCL bindings.
Allowing for shared memory streams, collections, values, and execution of kernels.

Kernels ran on a GPU can provide a considerable boost to performance in some use cases.

## Kernels
OpenCL kernels can be loaded from OpenCL files or generated from C# methods.
For an example C# to OpenCL kernel see Samples.

## Experimental
This is an experimental project and may get abandoned at any time.

## Note
A lot of IL instruction have not been accounted for at this time, some C# kernels may not compile.

## Contributions
Contributions are always welcome!
